# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Faced with problems

1. I don’t understand the code for implementing a carousel.
2. I haven't set up product price filtering, and I’m not sure how to do it.
3. When reloading the order or cart page, all orders disappear, and it resets to zero.
4. In the product categories, clicking on a product name to show items of that category on the website is causing issues.
5. On the product detail page, when viewing a product, it would be great to add a zoom-in effect, but I couldn’t manage to implement this. How can I do it?
6. When viewing a product on the detail page, additional images of the product should appear below. I haven’t added this feature. How can I do it?
7. The functionality for showing related products is not yet implemented.
8. The review feature isn’t implemented either, although I think I could do it if needed.
9. I haven't added a payment gateway method to my website yet.

<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
